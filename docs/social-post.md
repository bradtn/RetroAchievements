Been working on this for a while and finally feel good enough to share it. It's called RetroTrack - a companion app for RetroAchievements.

I made it because the current Android option is honestly painful with how many ads get shoved in your face. Mine has one small banner ad at the bottom, and if even that bugs you there's a one-time premium unlock that removes it. No subscriptions or anything like that, just pay once and you're good forever. Premium also gets you AMOLED theme, accent color customization, home screen widgets, and some other stuff.

Main features are tracking your daily streak (with reminders so you don't forget to play), browsing your games and achievements, checking out the achievement of the week, comparing with friends, that kind of thing.

Quick heads up - the RetroAchievements API is honestly kind of limited in what it can do, so there's some stuff I just can't pull off. Did my best with what's available though. Also you'll need to use your own API key from your RA account settings, just how it works.

I'm pretty active with development and always looking to make it better. If you've got ideas, find bugs, or just think something could be done differently I'd genuinely love to hear it. You can reach me here or shoot me an email at [YOUR EMAIL]. Not gonna ignore you or anything, I actually want the feedback.

Not trying to get rich off this, just want something that doesn't suck to use and maybe cover my costs. Happy to hear from you!
