Been working on this for a while and finally feel good enough to share it. It's called RetroTrack - a companion app for RetroAchievements.

I made it because the current Android option is honestly painful with how many ads get shoved in your face. Mine has one banner ad at the bottom, and if even that bugs you there's a cheap premium unlock that removes it plus adds some widgets and stuff.

Main features are tracking your daily streak (with reminders so you don't forget to play), browsing your games and achievements, checking out the achievement of the week, comparing with friends, that kind of thing.

Not trying to get rich off this, just want something that doesn't suck to use and maybe cover my costs. Happy to hear feedback!
